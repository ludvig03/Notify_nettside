/**
 * Index {@link Primitive}s and (optionally) merge similar vertices. When merged
 * and indexed, data is shared more efficiently between vertices. File size can
 * be reduced, and the GPU can sometimes use the vertex cache more efficiently.
 *
 * When welding, the 'tolerance' threshold determines which vertices qualify for
 * welding based on distance between the vertices as a fraction of the primitive's
 * bounding box (AABB). For example, tolerance=0.01 welds vertices within +/-1%
 * of the AABB's longest dimension. Other vertex attributes are also compared
 * during welding, with attribute-specific thresholds. For --tolerance=0, geometry
 * is indexed in place, without merging.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { weld } from '@gltf-transform/functions';
 *
 * await document.transform(
 * 	weld({ tolerance: 0.001 })
 * );
 * ```
